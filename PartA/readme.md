# 🦖 Cretaceous Dino Explorer — App Summary
```
Cretaceous Dino Explorer is an educational iOS game built using SwiftUI, SpriteKit, Core Data, and CoreML-style adaptive logic.
It introduces children and young learners to the Cretaceous period in a fun, interactive, game-based format while demonstrating modern iOS development practices required by the assignment.

🎯 Purpose
The app combines entertainment with learning, allowing users to control a dinosaur in a 2D side-scrolling environment while discovering facts about the Cretaceous era.
After each run, players are presented with a set of scientific facts they can read and explore at their own pace.

👦 Target Audience
Children aged 7–12, early learners, and students who enjoy dinosaurs, nature, and simple mobile games.
The game design and educational content are tailored to be easy to understand, visually appealing, and engaging.

# 🛠 Key Features
## 🎮 1. Playable 2D Dinosaur Game
```
Built using SpriteKit
Player controls a dinosaur that:
Runs
Jumps
Collects orbs
Avoids cactus hazards
Lives system (3 hits = game over)
Increasing challenge through adaptive difficulty
```

## 🧠 2. Cretaceous Educational Content
```
Over 12 scientifically accurate facts
Facts appear after completing a run (not during gameplay)
Players can optionally open a full list of facts at the end of the game
```

## 📊 3. Adaptive Difficulty (CoreML-style System)
```
Even without a full ML model, the app uses a CoreML-inspired algorithm that adjusts difficulty based on:
Score
Time survived
Orbs collected
Hazard hits taken
Remaining lives
Base difficulty selected by the user
This simulates machine-learning behavior and demonstrates knowledge of ML integration.
```

## 🧵 4. Data Persistence (Core Data)
```
The app stores:
High scores
Date of play
Selected difficulty
This provides a persistent record that users can view later under the High Scores screen.
```

## 🧭 5. Clean SwiftUI Navigation
```
The app includes several screens:
Home
Game
Learn (educational content)
High Scores (Core Data)
Settings (select difficulty & options)
All connected using NavigationStack architecture.
```

## 🎨 6. Image-Based Game Graphics
```
Replaces primitive shapes with real assets:
Dinosaur sprite
Orb item
Cactus hazard
Supports future expansion into animated sprites.
```

# 🧩 Technologies Used
```
SwiftUI – UI screens, navigation, state management
SpriteKit – 2D gameplay and physics
Core Data – persistent saving of high scores
CoreML-style adaptive logic – simulated model for difficulty prediction
Combine – reactive updates to game state
Xcode Asset Catalog – for importing dinosaur/orb/cactus images
```

# 🚀 Why This App Meets Assignment Requirements
✔ At least 3 screens (Home, Game, Learn, Settings, High Scores)
✔ Advanced UI + gameplay animations
✔ Navigation & architecture via SwiftUI + NavigationStack
✔ Data persistence via Core Data
✔ Integration of emerging tech (CoreML-style logic system)
✔ Polished visual assets & branding
✔ Educational purpose + clearly defined audience
✔ Strong potential for extension (animations, ML model, sound, etc.)
